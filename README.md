Welcome to ClassTech

An at-a-glance view of the technology your child's classmates use. 


Summary

If you are a parent of a child from Grade 3 - Grade 8, you've likely heard this statement more than once: "I'm the only one in my grade who doesn't have a phone.". If used with the parents of your child's class, you can all view the technology in the class and have an informed response.

This app is not currently hosted but may be in the future. Keep in touch!
